## Description

Portfolio created with React and Material UI. My motivation was seeing the improvement in my first portfolio and this one. This is an important project to build because every developer should have a portfolio. I learned how to use Material UI (of course there is still much more to learn), but it was a good start.

When you first load my portfolio, the default page is the about page<br>

<br>
The navigation bar has 4 links that can take you to the pages 'about', 'portfolio', 'contact', and 'resume'.<br>

Every page has the footer that has 3 icon links to my github, linkedin and twitter<br>
